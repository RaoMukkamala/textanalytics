The task is to choose any two novels and find out all the nouns that are used in common in both the novels.

Some hints:
Read the novel by line by line, parse each lines using pos_tagger to find out which nouns are used by each novel, store them in a list and finally find out the intersection of the lists of nouns of those two novels.

NLTK pos_tagger uses the following tags for nouns:
